1,Notice of Intent to Introduce a Proposal,"The first step in the legislative process is giving notice of intent to introduce a proposal. The Council Member sponsoring the measure must provide notice of his or her intent to submit the proposal—in writing—at a formal meeting of the full City Council. Giving notice is a procedural function that alerts all Council Members, affected City departments and divisions, and the general public about the proposal and its general subject matter. Notices are generally calendared under the order of new business. After notice is given, proposals hold-over to the next Council cycle for formal introduction, first reading, and referral."
2,Proposal Drafted,Council members or city staff draft the proposal.
3,"Introduction, First Reading & Referral","At a meeting of the full City Council, the proposal is taken up under unfinished business where the matter is formally introduced, given its first reading (by title only), and referred by the Council President to the standing committee(s) with subject-matter jurisdiction."
4,Public Hearings,"Committees provide a public forum where legislative and policy proposals are reviewed and evaluated, perfected through the regular amendatory process, and put in final form for recommendation to the full City Council. Committees also provide the most significant opportunity for the public to engage in the legislative process, through the conduct of public hearings and the acceptance of public testimony or public comments."
5,Committee Action & Second Reading,"When a committee has completed its evaluation of each proposal, it forwards its recommendation in the form of a committee report to the full City Council. Committee recommendations are limited to: approve; approve as amended; do not approve; or forward without recommendation."
6,Council Action,"The City Council may act on all reported items in a single omnibus motion, or may separate individual proposals for formal consideration and action. At this stage of the process, the proposal may be: passed or adopted, and transmitted to the Mayor; amended by the City Council and either passed or adopted and transmitted to the Mayor; remanded back to the committee of reference or to another committee for further consideration; or defeated by formal action of the City Council."
7,Mayoral Consideration,"The Mayor’s signature is the final step in the legislative process before any proposal can become effective. Pursuant to the City Charter, the Mayor must approve or disapprove all measures acted upon by the City Council within five days (excepting Sundays). Within that period, the Mayor must either: (1) Approve the actions and authenticate the same by signature; (2) veto the actions and return the same, with stated objections thereto, to the City Clerk; or (3) allow the actions to become effective without signature after the five-day period expires."
8,Publication & Codification,"Under state law, all ordinances, resolutions, and other actions must be published in the City’s official newspaper before becoming effective. Publication generally occurs eight days after Council’s final action, in the Saturday edition of the next week. After publication, the Clerk’s Office indexes all official actions and prepares the original documents for permanent archival. After publication, all ordinances are codified within the proper titles, chapters, and sections of the Minneapolis Code of Ordinances."
